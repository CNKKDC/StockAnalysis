## Introduce
StockAnalysis is a program that analyzes stocks based on public funds, scoring stocks held by most funds in combination with their one-year interest rate and the percentage of positions held.Of course, if a fund's interest rate is high, then its holdings of stocks will be higher points;Conversely, if a fund has a negative one-year interest rate, it will have a corresponding deduction for the stocks it holds.So we know whether the stock is popular or not in the market.
